# TO-DO

### IconButtons
- Allow the IconButtons to accept a size input, to change the height and width (just one size, since the button is meant to be square)

### Forms
- I'd like to make the forms back into modals, controlled by the edit buttons on the table and an add button on the top of the table (modals were removed because i thought they were contributing to why my information wasn't sending to the database, but I don't think they were the issue.)

### Items Table
- headers are centered while the content is left aligned

### Project Page
- I was going to have a project page containing the instructions for this assignment, formatted in the same way i do most of my progress html files, but the implementation was more complicated than expected, and there's no time before the deadline for me to properly implement this at the moment.

### Navbar
- I was thinking of having the nav bar anchored to the top of the page
